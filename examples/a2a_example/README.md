# LangGraph Currency Agent with A2A Protocol

This sample demonstrates a currency conversion agent built with [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) and exposed through the A2A protocol. It showcases conversational interactions with support for multi-turn dialogue and streaming responses.

## How It Works

This agent uses LangGraph with OpenAI to provide currency exchange information through a ReAct agent pattern. The A2A protocol enables standardized interaction with the agent, allowing clients to send requests and receive real-time updates.

    participant Client as A2A Client

    participant Agent as LangGraph Agent
    participant API as Frankfurter API

    Client->>Server: Send task with currency query
    Server->>Agent: Forward query to currency agent

    alt Complete Information
        Agent->>API: Call get_exchange_rate tool
        API->>Agent: Return exchange rate data
        Agent->>Server: Process data & return result
        Server->>Client: Respond with currency information
    else Incomplete Information
        Agent->>Server: Request additional input
        Server->>Client: Set state to "input-required"
        Client->>Server: Send additional information
        Server->>Agent: Forward additional info
        Agent->>API: Call get_exchange_rate tool
        API->>Agent: Return exchange rate data
        Agent->>Server: Process data & return result
        Server->>Client: Respond with currency information
    end

    alt With Streaming
        Note over Client,Server: Real-time status updates
        Server->>Client: "Looking up exchange rates..."
        Server->>Client: "Processing exchange rates..."
        Server->>Client: Final result
    end
```
The diagram illustrates how a client interacts with a LangGraph-based currency agent via the A2A protocol to get currency conversion information.

The interaction involves several components:
- **Client**: The end user or application using the A2A protocol to send a query. You can read [here](client/README.md) more informations about the **Client** implementation.
- **Server**: The A2A Server handling the communication between the client and the LangGraph agent.
- **Agent**: The LangGraph-powered agent that understands the query and fetches exchange rate data. You can read [here](agent/README.md) more informations about the **Server/Agent** implementation.
- **API**: The external data source (Frankfurter API) used to retrieve real-time currency exchange rates.

### Main Flow
1. Initial Request
   - The **Client** sends a currency query to the Server (e.g., "*What's the exchange rate from USD to EUR?*").
   - The **Server** forwards this query to the Agent.

### Two Possible Branches
1. Complete Information
   - If the user's initial input includes all necessary details (e.g., base currency, target currency, and amount):
     - The Agent calls the **Frankfurter API** using a **tool** (e.g., `get_exchange_rate`) to retrieve the exchange rate.
     - The **API** responds with the data.
     - The **Agent** processes the data and sends the final result (e.g., "100 USD = 92 EUR") back to the **Server**.
     - The **Server** then responds to the **Client** with the information.

2. Incomplete Information
   - If the initial input is missing key details (like the amount or one of the currencies):
     - The **Agent** notifies the **Server** that it needs more input.
     - The **Server** sets the task state to `"input-required"` and notifies the **Client**.
     - The **Client** provides the missing details.
     - The **Server** forwards this additional info to the Agent.
     - The **Agent** now proceeds with the API call, receives the data, processes it, and sends the result back to the **Client** via the Server.

### Streaming Enhancements
- If streaming is enabled, the **Client** receives **real-time updates** as the task progresses:
  - Status messages such as:
    - "*Looking up exchange rates...*"
    - "*Processing exchange rates...*"
    - And finally, the **conversion result**.
  - This improves the user experience by keeping them informed during the agent's thinking process.

## Key Features

- **Multi-turn Conversations**: Agent can request additional information when needed
- **Real-time Streaming**: Provides status updates during processing
- **Push Notifications**: Support for webhook-based notifications
- **Conversational Memory**: Maintains context across interactions
- **Currency Exchange Tool**: Integrates with Frankfurter API for real-time rates


## Technical Implementation

- **LangGraph ReAct Agent**: Uses the ReAct pattern for reasoning and tool usage
- **Streaming Support**: Provides incremental updates during processing
- **Checkpoint Memory**: Maintains conversation state between turns
- **Push Notification System**: Webhook-based updates with JWK authentication
- **A2A Protocol Integration**: Full compliance with A2A specifications

## Limitations

- Only supports text-based input/output (no multi-modal support)
- Uses Frankfurter API which has limited currency options
- Memory is session-based and not persisted between server restarts
